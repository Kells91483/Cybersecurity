## Red Vs. Blue Project

You will work on a Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario in which you will play the role of both pentester and SOC analyst.
As the Red Team, you will attack a vulnerable VM within your environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. As Blue Team, you will use Kibana to review logs taken during their Day 1 engagement. You'll use the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for their report.
Then, you will interpret your log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that you've successfully performed.
